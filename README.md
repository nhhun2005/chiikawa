# Chiikawa - reactjs mini project

This is my first ever mini project learning reactjs.

# This is the first and also the final version of the repository, I won't update this anymore since I reached the goal of the project:
+ Give a list of Chiikawa show's characters.
+ Show there description.
+ Able to go to the next/previous character by buttons.
+ Apply knowledge of useState and useEffect in reactjs.

# Note: I didn't ask copyright to use these characters image so if there is a copyright problem, feel free to contact me to take down this repository! Thanks.
